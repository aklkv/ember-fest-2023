### HashiCorp Cloud Platform

<br>

<v-clicks>

- ***9*** local addons
- ***13*** in-repo engines
- ***8*** teams
- ***126*** ICs
- ***50*** PR/day
- ***22*** API services
- ***no ember-data***

## Where we were a year ago

<br>

<v-clicks>

- `yarn` + `workspaces`
- ember 3.28
- no embroider
- slow builds/rebuilds ~2min/~1.5min

</v-clicks>

<!--
  - full app
  - individual engines (much faster but has it's own issues)
-->

---
layout: default
---

## How do we move forward?

<v-clicks>

- Big lift to move to ember 4.8
- move to GHA
- Helios
- Embroider
- `pnpm` + `turborepo`
- glint + template imports

</v-clicks>

<!--
  - reduce build times
  - improve DX
-->

## Helios

<br>

<v-clicks>

- provides primitive building blocks
- multi product
- accessability focused

</v-clicks>

## Think big, start small

<br>

<v-clicks>

- start with RFC (Hermes)
- get buy-in from stakeholders
- be vocal
- be inclusive
- be patient
- be ready to compromise
- be ready to fail
- stay optimistic

</v-clicks>

---
layout: default
---

## You are ready to start

<br>

<v-clicks>

- is there blueprint or a codemod (make one)
- solve it for yourself first, then for others
- make smaller changes
- make it easy to adopt
- use atomic commits (Conventional Commits)
- notify stakeholders

</v-clicks>

---
layout: default
---

## Continues Process

<br>

<v-clicks>

- keep improving
- read ember RFCs
- watch main repos on github

</v-clicks>

---
layout: default

## Embroider

<br>

<v-clicks>

- run experimental branch with embroider (naive)
- convert local addons to v2
- identify issues
- fix
- repeat

</v-clicks>

## Are we there yet?

<br>

<v-clicks>

No

but we are getting there

</v-clicks>

<br>

<v-clicks>

- initial build: 2.5min -> 1.5min
- rebuild: 1.5min -> ~5s

</v-clicks>
